To start, fork [this repository](https://github.com/NOVA-Uncommon-Coders/FileI-O-Extended).

## Description

Create a project called `People` with [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oakes/java-assignments/master/projects/People/people.csv) in the project root. Read the csv file into a `HashMap<String, ArrayList<Person>>` that maps country name to a list of people who are from that country. Then loop over the lists in your `HashMap` and sort them by last name.

## Requirements

* Create a `Person` class to store all the columns in the csv file.
* Create a `HashMap<String, ArrayList<Person>>` that maps country name to a list of people from that country.
* Loop over the `HashMap` and sort each list by last name.
* Override `toString` in the `Person` class to print out a nicely-formatted string for that person (something like "Martha Jenkins from France").
* Print out the entire `HashMap` at the end.
* Break your code into separate methods.
* Write the resulting `HashMap` to a file called "people.json" formatted as JSON.


## HARDMODE
* Write tests for your methods.
* Modify your `compareTo` method so it sorts by first name if the last names are the same.

## LUDICROUSMODE
* Store your HashMap inside a generic class called DataRepository. DataRepository should accept generic type T.
* Inside `DataRepository`, create a constructor with a `String filename`.
  * In the constructor, set a field of type `Scanner` to read from the specified file.
* Inside `DataRepository`, create a populateData method:
   * Its return type should be void.
   * It should accept a generic functional interface of your own creation called FileObjectCreator. FileObjectCreator should have one method, parse, which accepts a string and returns T.
   * It should accept a second generic functional interface of your own creation called ObjectKeyMapper. ObjectKeyMapper should have one function, map, which accepts T and returns a String.
   * While the scanner has tokens, use the parse method of the first passed in functional interface parameter to create a person Object. Store each object in your HashMap like before, using the key generated by the second functional interface parameter
* In main, create a new DataRepository that accepts Person objects.
* On your DataRepository object, call populateData, passing in a lambda expression that converts file inputs to Person objects.
